		    	<p>Boston has always been in vogue as a hi-tech hub. Powered by industries like like robotics and medicine, the city has many salient features, world-renowned educational institutions, a lower cost of living, and relatively higher quality of life have all propelled Boston to flourish as one of the nation’s leading tech hubs.</p>
		    	<p>We received some interest to establish a chapter here. While we are working out the logistics, please join the slack channels and engage with the elves group if you want to volunteer. </p>
