Mock Interviews is a new initiative that you can leverage to level up your interviewing skills.

We believe that interviewing is a skill that you can learn, and that practice makes perfect.

Every Saturday, the SDE Skills community comes together and has a mock interview. The **Interviewee** receives constructive feedback from the **Interviewer** and the rest of the group.

If you are looking to practice interviewing (as an **Interviewee** or **Interviewer**) in a safe space, stress-free environment, **join us!**

## What's the format?

- 45 minutes interview + 30 minutes discussion + 15 mins buffer

We have the following roles:

**Interviewer**:

- Asks the Interviewee an Algorithm/Data Structures type of question
- Guides the Interviewee through the different stages of the Interview
- Is the Interviewee ally
- Gives feedback at the end of the Interview

**Interviewee**:

- Talks about his or her professional experience
- Gets asked an Algorithm/Data Structures type of question

**Note Taker**:

- An observer that takes notes during the Interview

## When?
